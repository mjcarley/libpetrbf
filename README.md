# PetRBF library

This is a fork of the PetRBF code of Yokota, Barba, and Knepley,
intended to compile using standard autoconf tools, to provide a
library for integration in other codes. The original code is licensed

# Original PetRBF description

Many applications in computational science need to approximate a
function based on finite data. When the data are in a certain sense
“scattered” in their domain, one very powerful technique is radial
basis function (RBF) interpolation.  For many years, the wide
applicability of RBF interpolation was hindered by its numerical
difficulty and expense.  Indeed, in their mathematical expression, RBF
methods produce an ill-conditioned linear system, for which a direct
solution becomes prohibitive for more than a few thousand data points.

We have developed a parallel algorithm for RBF interpolation that
exhibits O(N) complexity, requires O(N) storage, and scales
excellently up to a thousand processes. The algorithm uses the GMRES
iterative solver with a restricted additive Schwarz method (RASM) as a
preconditioner and a fast matrix-vector algorithm. Previous fast RBF
methods — achieving at most O(N log N) complexity — were developed
using multiquadric and polyharmonic basis functions. In contrast, the
present method uses Gaussians with a small variance. The fast decay of
the Gaussian basis function allows rapid convergence of the iterative
solver even when the subdomains in the RASM are very small. The method
was implemented in parallel using the PETSc library (developer
version). Numerical experiments demonstrate its capability in problems
of RBF interpolation with more than 50 million data points, timing at
106 seconds (19 iterations for an error tolerance of 10e−15) on 1024
processors of a Blue Gene/L (700 MHz PowerPC processors).
